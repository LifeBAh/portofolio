# GitHub Pages Configuration

This file ensures proper GitHub Pages deployment.

## Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the root directory with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" in GitHub Pages settings

## Build Status

This is a static site that doesn't require a build process. GitHub Pages will serve the files directly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Site not updating**: Check if GitHub Pages is enabled and the branch is correct
- **404 errors**: Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
- **Styling issues**: Check if all CSS files are properly linked
- **Mobile issues**: Test responsive design on different devices

## Performance Tips

- Optimize images before uploading
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript if making custom changes
- Use GitHub's CDN for faster global delivery
